# Java-based-Restaurant-Management-System
Coded a program to replicate a small scale Restaurant in Java11 on BlueJ for my Class X ICSE Practical Project Examination. The application could take orders, delete orders, generate a bill, and give options for take-away and delivery. I made use of the concepts of single dimensional arrays and functions following a menu-driven approach.
